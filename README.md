# 😸 Exploding Kitten, a web-based game. 

This will be an online single-player card game that consists of 4 different types of cards

- Cat card 😼
- Defuse card 🙅‍♂️
- Shuffle card 🔀
- Exploding kitten card 💣

There will be a button to start the game. When the game is started there will be a deck of 5 cards ordered randomly. Each time user clicks on the deck a card is revealed and that card is removed from the deck. A player wins the game once he draws all 5 cards from the deck and there is no card left to draw. 

Rules –
- If the card drawn from the deck is a cat card, then the card is removed from the deck.
- If the card is exploding kitten (bomb) then the player loses the game.
- If the card is a defusing card, then the card is removed from the deck. This card can be used to defuse one bomb that may come in subsequent cards drawn from the deck.
- If the card is a shuffle card, then the game is restarted and the deck is filled with 5 cards again.


features:
1. Automatically saves the game for a user at every stage so the user can continue from where he left off last time.
2. Real-time update of points on the leaderboard for all the users if they are playing simultaneously.
